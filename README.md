# TOP Library

## Installation

This project was to build a simply library project, leverage local storage api, create modal forms to add data. I leveraged typescript and localstorage api to add books. Each book will display with an image if added. It should seed with a few test books. Note this page is not very responsive, it looks fine on larger displays, smaller ones things get out of whack and it needs some work.
